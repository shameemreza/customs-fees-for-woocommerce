# Customs Fees for WooCommerce - Development Tasks

## Priority 1: Critical Features (Product Manager Feedback)

### 1. CSV Import/Export for Bulk Updates ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Problem:** No way to bulk update Country of Origin for products  
**Solution:** Add WooCommerce CSV import/export integration

#### Tasks:

- [x] Create `class-cfwc-export-import.php` handler class
- [x] Add export columns for HS Code and Country of Origin
- [x] Convert country codes to names on export for readability
- [x] Add import mapping for both country codes and names
- [x] Support multiple column name variations (HS Code, Tariff Code, etc.)
- [x] Handle variations (inherit from parent or override)
- [x] Add documentation for bulk update process

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Merchants can export products with customs data
- Country names are human-readable in CSV (not just codes)
- Import accepts both "United States" and "US" formats
- Columns auto-map on import screen

---

### 2. Product Category-Based Tariff Rules üéØ CRITICAL

**Problem:** Current country-only logic is **fundamentally flawed** for real tariffs  
**Reality:** China‚ÜíUS tariffs range from 0% to 100% depending on product category!

#### Current System Flaws:

- ‚ùå Single rate for all China‚ÜíUS products (completely wrong!)
- ‚ùå No way to handle category-specific tariffs
- ‚ùå Can't implement actual Section 301/232 tariffs correctly
- ‚ùå Forces merchants to create workarounds or incorrect calculations

#### Refined Implementation Plan:

##### Phase 1: Data Structure Enhancement

- [ ] Extend rule structure to support multiple matching criteria:
  ```php
  [
      'from_country' => 'CN',
      'to_country' => 'US',
      'match_type' => 'category|hs_code|all', // NEW
      'category_ids' => [15, 22],             // WooCommerce category IDs
      'hs_code_pattern' => '6109*',           // HS Code prefix matching
      'rate' => 69,                            // Actual apparel rate
      'label' => 'Section 301 - Apparel',
      'priority' => 10,                        // Higher priority = checked first
      'notes' => 'Apparel particularly high (~69%)'
  ]
  ```

##### Phase 2: Matching Logic Implementation

- [ ] Create rule matching priority system:
  1. **Exact HS Code match** (highest priority)
  2. **HS Code prefix match** (e.g., 6109\* for apparel)
  3. **Product category match**
  4. **Country-only match** (fallback)
- [ ] Implement `class-cfwc-rule-matcher.php` for complex matching
- [ ] Support AND/OR logic for multiple criteria
- [ ] Add rule testing/preview functionality

##### Phase 3: UI Enhancements

- [ ] Redesign rule creation form with tabs:
  - **Basic**: Country selection
  - **Products**: Category selector, HS code field
  - **Rate**: Percentage/flat, stacking options
  - **Advanced**: Priority, date ranges, notes
- [ ] Add visual rule builder with conditions
- [ ] Show which products match each rule (preview)
- [ ] Add "Import from Template" for common scenarios

##### Phase 4: Pre-configured Templates

- [ ] Create accurate China‚ÜíUS templates based on actual tariffs:
  ```php
  $china_us_templates = [
      ['name' => 'Apparel/Clothing', 'hs_prefix' => '61,62', 'rate' => 7.5, 'section_301_rate' => 61.5],
      ['name' => 'Electronics (Consumer)', 'hs_prefix' => '85', 'rate' => 0, 'max_rate' => 50],
      ['name' => 'Steel Products', 'rate' => 25, 'section_232' => true],
      ['name' => 'Aluminum Products', 'rate' => 10, 'section_232' => true],
      ['name' => 'Automobiles', 'rate' => 25, 'additional' => 75],
      ['name' => 'Auto Parts', 'rate' => 25],
      ['name' => 'Solar Equipment', 'rate' => 50],
      ['name' => 'Batteries (Non-EV)', 'rate' => 25],
      ['name' => 'Medical Devices', 'rate' => 25, 'specific_items' => 50],
      ['name' => 'Semiconductors', 'rate' => 50],
      ['name' => 'Footwear', 'rate' => 7.5, 'max_rate' => 15],
      ['name' => 'Toys', 'rate' => 7.5, 'max_rate' => 25],
  ];
  ```

##### Phase 5: Rule Management & Testing

- [ ] Add bulk rule import/export (CSV)
- [ ] Create rule conflict detection
- [ ] Add "Test Product" feature to see which rules apply
- [ ] Implement rule versioning/history
- [ ] Add effective date management (tariffs change!)

#### Technical Architecture:

```php
// New database structure (wp_cfwc_rules table)
CREATE TABLE wp_cfwc_rules (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    from_country VARCHAR(2),
    to_country VARCHAR(2),
    match_type ENUM('all', 'category', 'hs_code', 'combined'),
    category_ids TEXT,  // JSON array
    hs_code_pattern VARCHAR(20),
    rate DECIMAL(5,2),
    rate_type ENUM('percentage', 'flat'),
    priority INT DEFAULT 0,
    stacking_allowed BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    effective_from DATE,
    effective_to DATE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Success Criteria:

- ‚úÖ Can accurately represent China‚ÜíUS tariff complexity
- ‚úÖ Merchants can set different rates for different product types
- ‚úÖ System matches most specific rule first
- ‚úÖ Clear UI shows which rule applies to which product
- ‚úÖ Calculation accuracy matches real-world tariffs

---

### 3. Rule Stacking Clarity & UI Improvements üìä CRITICAL

**Problem:** Users selecting "China ‚Üí US" preset don't realize it stacks with general US rules, resulting in unexpected total rates (e.g., 25% + 10% = 35%)

#### Immediate Fixes Needed:

##### Phase 1: Visual Clarity (Quick Win)

- [ ] Add stacking indicator in rules table:
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è China ‚Üí US (25%) + General ‚Üí US (10%) = 35% TOTAL
  ```
- [ ] Color-code stacking rules (yellow background when multiple apply)
- [ ] Add "Effective Rates" summary box showing all combinations
- [ ] Show warning icon when creating overlapping rules

##### Phase 2: Stacking Control Options

- [ ] Add stacking mode selector per rule:
  - **Stack** (default): Adds to other rules
  - **Override**: Replaces lower priority rules
  - **Exclusive**: Only this rule applies if matched
- [ ] Implement priority system (1-100, higher = checked first)
- [ ] Add "Preview Impact" before saving rule

##### Phase 3: Testing & Preview Tools

- [ ] Create "Rate Calculator" tool:

  ```
  Test Product: [_____________________]
  Origin: [China ‚ñº]  Destination: [United States ‚ñº]
  Category: [Electronics ‚ñº]  HS Code: [______]

  MATCHING RULES:
  ‚úì China ‚Üí US Electronics (Section 301): 25%
  ‚úì General ‚Üí US Import: 10%
  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
  TOTAL CUSTOMS FEE: 35%
  ```

- [ ] Add "Dry Run" mode for testing without affecting live site
- [ ] Show affected products count when editing rules

##### Phase 4: Smart Defaults & Guidance

- [ ] When selecting preset, ask: "Replace existing rules or add to them?"
- [ ] Add setup wizard with common scenarios:
  - "I only ship from one country" ‚Üí Simple setup
  - "I ship from multiple countries" ‚Üí Advanced setup
  - "I need category-specific rates" ‚Üí Expert setup
- [ ] Include tooltips explaining stacking behavior
- [ ] Add "Common Mistakes" warning section

## Notes from Product Manager

> "The China‚ÜíUS scenario is our most complex use case. If we can handle the varying tariff rates by product category (electronics at 0-50%, apparel at 7.5-70%, etc.), we'll cover most merchant needs. The current country-only approach works for simple scenarios but falls short for real-world compliance."

> "Merchants are used to working with CSV files for bulk updates. This is table stakes for any serious e-commerce plugin. They should be able to export, update in Excel, and reimport without technical knowledge."

> "The stacking confusion is real. One merchant thought they were charging 10% but actually had three rules stacking to 30%. We need better visualization of how rules combine."
