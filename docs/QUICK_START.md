# Quick Start Guide - Customs Fees for WooCommerce

Welcome! This guide will help you set up customs fee calculations in under five minutes.

## Step 1: Access settings (30 seconds)

After activating the plugin, navigate to:
**WooCommerce > Settings > Tax > Customs Fees**

You'll see the main configuration page with two sections:

- Global settings
- Fee rules management

## Step 2: Set default origin (30 seconds)

Choose how to determine product origin for items without individual settings:

1. **Use store location** - Products ship from your store address
2. **Custom country** - Select a specific default country
3. **None** - Each product must have origin set individually

**Tip:** Most stores choose "Custom country" and select their primary supplier location.

### Use priorities wisely

- **51-100:** General category rules
- **100+:** Fallback rules

### Test incrementally

After each rule, test with sample products before adding more.

### Document your rules

Use clear, descriptive names like "China Electronics 25% Section 301" instead of "Rule 1".
